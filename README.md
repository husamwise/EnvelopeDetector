In this project, we implemented a envelope detector. Detector circuit defined in EnvelopeDetector.m file. solve_by_be.m and solve_by_trpz.m are solve numericaly detector function. Detector function was implemented by lecturer of mat214 lesson at Gebze Technical University. We implemented trapezoidal ODE solver and backward euler ODE solver function.

Results of function:
